## Sublime Text 2 - Your text editor

A text editor is one of the most important tool of a developer. Go to [this page](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) and download Sublime Text 2 for your OSX (should be the first link). Install it (meaning you have to drag & drop the app **into** the `Applications` folder, don't skip it!).

It is free without any time limitation but a popup will appear every ten save to remind there is a license to buy.
Just hit `Esc` when this happens, but feel free to buy it if you really like this one (there are alternatives).

Again,  make sure that Sublime Text is there, not in the disk image you downloaded. To make sure it's correct, once Sublime Text is installed, unmount the "Sublime Text 2" disk in the left panel of Finder. If Finder complains, that's because you did something wrong. Ask a teacher.
