## GitHub

We need to configure Git with SSH keys, this way you won't have to put your password each
time you want to `git push` some modifications.

It is a tricky concept and a tricky setup, fortunately GitHub wrote a great article.
Just [go to this article](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/#step-2-generate-a-new-ssh-key), and select your environment at the top (Mac or Linux). If you need help, ask a teacher. *Do not* download GitHub for Mac, follow the part with SSH Keys.

**NB:** when asked for a passphrase, don't put your laptop password or your github password. It is
important to protect your keys with a password, otherwise anyone having access to these files
will be able to impersonate your GitHub account (and get access to your private code for instance).
