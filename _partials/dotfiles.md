## Your Configuration

Hackers love to refine and polish their shell and tools. We'll start with a great default configuration provided by [Le Wagon](http://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles), stored on Github. As your configuration is personal, you need your own repository storing it, so you first need to fork it to your GitHub account.

:arrow_right: [Go to this page](https://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles/fork) and **fork** the repository to your account.
Forking means that it will create a new repo in your Github account, identical to the original one.

Then follow the instructions in the readme of the repo you've just forked. Once done,
come back to this tutorial.
