## Oh-my-zsh - Fancy your terminal

We will use the shell named `zsh` instead of `bash`, the default one.

```bash
$ curl -L http://install.ohmyz.sh | sh
```

Be extremely careful, at the end of this script, it will prompt for your laptop password again.
You have to write it correctly and hit `Enter`.

Now quit the terminal (`⌘` + `Q`), and restart it.

You should see something like this:

If not, **stop right away** and call a teacher.

On Mac, open `Terminal > Preferences` and set the "Pro" theme as default in `Réglages`.

Quit and relaunch the terminal. It should now have a nice black background, more easy on the eyes.
